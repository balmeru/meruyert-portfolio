## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm Meruyert Balgabek — a strategic thinker with deep roots in macroeconomic research and investment analysis, and a growing passion for solving complex business problems through clarity, structure, and collaboration.

I bring experience in financial modeling, economic forecasting, market analysis, and performance optimization — having worked on national-level development projects, M&A cases, equity analysis, and real-world strategy evaluations. From quantifying early childhood education investments to evaluating major M&A deals, I thrive at the intersection of data, business context, and impact.

While I began my journey in economic research and financial markets, I’ve discovered that **consulting and strategy work reflect not just my strengths — but what energizes me**: diving into diverse industries, generating insights, aligning vision with data, and making sense of complexity. I’ve recently grown to embrace detail-orientation, balancing my natural visionary mindset with structured analysis and delivery.

Earlier this year, I received an offer from Leading Business School as a Strategy Research Assistant, and recently interviewed with  Major Consulting Company’s Strategy & Operations team — these experiences affirmed that I belong in environments where analytical depth meets business transformation.

I believe business is more than maximizing revenue or minimizing cost — it’s about creating lasting impact and helping organizations deliver meaningful, sustainable value to society.

I’m now actively pursuing roles in strategy, consulting, and investment analysis — especially in places where the culture values inclusion, continuous growth, and meaningful work.

This portfolio is a reflection of who I am: values-driven, analytically rigorous, and globally minded. It’s a curated collection of real assignments, projects, and insights — not just what I can do, but *how I think*.

Let’s build the future with strategy, kindness, and clarity.
